# Local Folks Solving Local Problems

### HOW IT WORKS

Hack for Western Mass is a group of web and software developers, designers, project managers, data scientists, and organizers who work together with local organizations to solve challenges with technology. 

We work closely with organizations to identify and define projects. Then we'll form a team consisting of a project manager and a group of designers and developers dedicated to your project. We'll pull in other expertise from our diverse team as needed, completing the project from inception to deployment and even providing maintenance as needed. 

Some of the organizations we've worked with in the past include the Food Bank, the David Ruggle Center, the Center for New Americans, Dial/Self, the Prison Policy Initiative, the Literacy Project, the South Hadley Food Pantry, Girls Inc. of Holyoke, the Hilltown Seed Saving Network, Rick's Place, CISA, and more. See our [projects on GitHub](https://github.com/hackforwesternmass).

Do you know an organization working on issues that affect our community that could use help from local technology professionals? We want to help you!

### WHY CIVIC HACKING?

In cities throughout the country, hackathons are redefining the meaning of civic engagement. Programmers, designers, developers, and data crunchers gather together to apply their skills for no other reason than to make their communities better. 

Participants in Hack for Western Mass meet people, learn new skills, and make difference. You're welcome to come when you can, join a team as a core member, or help organize meetings. Come join us and hack our communitities.

Interested in participating? Look for the next meeting [on MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/wmasswebdev/). In the meantime, tell us a little [about yourself](http://bit.ly/h4wm-register).

### BACKGROUND

On weekends in June 2013, 2014 and 2015, web and software developers, designers, community organizers, and other folks from all over Western Mass gathered to tackle local challenges with technology. Hack for Western Mass was one of many events happening nationwide as part of the National Day of Civic Hacking, an annual event held in June.

While a rewarding experience for all involved, it became clear to those participating that it takes more than a weekend to produce something of lasting value and to fulfill the mission of creating truly useful solutions to help solve challenges relevant to our neighborhoods, our cities, our states and our country. 

In 2017, Hack for Western Mass began meeting as a monthly meetup to provide ongoing development and support for local organizations.
